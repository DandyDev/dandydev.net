After a brutal attack on my VPS left the previous iteration of this website in shambles, I decided to make things easier and more fun for the next version. Instead of using an [monolithic and oudated CMS](http://diem-project.org/) built with [an ancient version of a framework](http://symfony.com/legacy) in a [language](http://php.net/) I've grown to dislike a lot ([just like some other folks](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/)), I've decided to take the lean-and-mean route to heavenly bliss. So as of now, this blog is built with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), a static site/blog generator written in Python. This also fits nicely with my recent love for Python.

[Other people](http://arunrocks.com/moving-blogs-to-pelican/) [have written](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/) about their Pelican experiences already, so I'll leave it to them to explain how truly cool and easy this way of blogging really is. I do want to mention though, that being able to write my blog-posts and pages in [my favorite Markdown editor](http://mouapp.com/) and managing the whole blog through GitHub for versioning, is perry darn awesome!

What I also want to share, is the Pelican-theme I developed for this blog. Twitter's Bootstrap just got a major update to version 3, so I thought I'd base my theme on that. Nothing like that existed yet for Pelican, so I looked at some existing themes and hacked something new together. The result makes use of [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) to offset my horribly lacking design skills. Of course, being a good boyscout means open sourcing just about everything you build, so [that's what I did](https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3).

Wrapping up this glorious rebirth post, I'm gonna promise yet again that I'll do my very very best to keep this blog up-to-date. <small>Just don't expect too much</small>
