Title: About

I'm Daan Debie, a Software Engineer from The Netherlands working on freelance basis. I have extensive experience in developing 
complex systems and compelling products. On top of my experience as a Software craftsman/developer, I'm also an expert in 
data engineering & the Hadoop ecosystem, containerization (Docker et al.) and programmable infrastructure. My languages of 
choice are Clojure, Scala and Python, and I'm fluent in Java as well. See GitHub for some of my side-projects.

I live in Haarlem with [my lovely wife](http://allthingspretty.nl) and 2 Maine Coons.

Feel free to approach me if you need my skills!
