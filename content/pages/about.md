Title: About

I'm Daan Debie, a Software Engineer from The Netherlands. I work at [The New Motion](http://www.thenewmotion.com), a company in Amsterdam specializing in infrastructure for Electrical cars. I work there as a Big Data Engineer, centralizing their data collection, analytics and BI efforts using the Hadoop stack. My languages of choice are Python and Scala, and I'm fluent in Java as well. See GitHub for some of my side-projects.

I live in Haarlem with [my lovely wife](http://allthingspretty.nl) and 2 Maine Coons.
