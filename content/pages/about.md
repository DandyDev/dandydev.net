Title: About

I'm Daan Debie, a Software Engineer from The Netherlands. I work at [Info.nl](http://info.nl), a Full Service Internetbureau in Amsterdam. I specialize in Big Data/anything Hadoop-related and building Java web applications. My languages of choice are Java and Python, and learning Scala is high on my to-do list. See GitHub for some of my side-projects.

I live in Rotterdam with my wife and 2 Maine Coons.
